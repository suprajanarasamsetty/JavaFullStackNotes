The provided Java code defines a `ConnectionFactory` class, which is a singleton responsible for managing database connections. This class reads database connection properties from a configuration file and provides a method to obtain a `Connection` object. Let's break down the code step-by-step to understand its components and functionality in detail.

### Class and Singleton Pattern

```java
package utils;

import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.Properties;

import com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver;

public class ConnectionFactory {
```

- **Package Declaration:** The class is part of the `utils` package.
- **Imports:** Necessary imports for file reading, SQL connections, exception handling, and properties management.
- **Class Declaration:** Declares the `ConnectionFactory` class, which will handle database connections.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures only one instance of `ConnectionFactory` exists. This is achieved by using a private static final instance and a private constructor.

### Singleton Instance

```java
private static final ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ConnectionFactory();
```

- **Static Final Instance:** A single instance of `ConnectionFactory` is created and stored in a static final field. This ensures that there is only one instance of the class (singleton pattern).

### Properties for Database Configuration

```java
private Properties props = new Properties();
```

- **Properties Object:** A `Properties` object is used to hold database configuration properties such as the URL, username, and password.

### Private Constructor

```java
private ConnectionFactory() {
    try {
        props.load(new FileReader("src/main/resources/db.properties"));
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

- **Private Constructor:** The constructor is private to prevent instantiation from outside the class.
- **Load Properties:** The constructor loads the database properties from a file located at `src/main/resources/db.properties`.
- **Exception Handling:** If an `IOException` occurs while reading the properties file, the exception is caught and printed to the stack trace.

### Public Method to Get the Singleton Instance

```java
public static ConnectionFactory getConnectionFactory() {
    return connectionFactory;
}
```

- **getConnectionFactory Method:** This static method returns the singleton instance of `ConnectionFactory`.

### Method to Get a Database Connection

```java
public Connection getConnection() {
    try {
        return DriverManager.getConnection(
            props.getProperty("url"),
            props.getProperty("username"),
            props.getProperty("password")
        );
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return null;
}
```

- **getConnection Method:** This method uses the `DriverManager.getConnection` method to establish a database connection.
  - **URL:** The database URL is retrieved from the properties object.
  - **Username:** The database username is retrieved from the properties object.
  - **Password:** The database password is retrieved from the properties object.
- **Exception Handling:** If an `SQLException` occurs while establishing the connection, the exception is caught and printed to the stack trace.
- **Return Connection:** If the connection is successfully established, it is returned. Otherwise, the method returns `null`.

### Code Explanation in Detail

1. **Singleton Pattern:**
   - Ensures that there is only one instance of `ConnectionFactory` throughout the application. This is useful for managing a limited resource like database connections efficiently.
   
2. **Loading Properties:**
   - The database connection details are externalized in a properties file (`db.properties`). This makes the configuration easy to manage and modify without changing the source code.
   
3. **Creating Connection:**
   - The `getConnection` method uses the `DriverManager` class to create a connection to the database using the properties loaded from the file.
   
4. **Exception Handling:**
   - The code includes basic exception handling by printing stack traces. In a production environment, more robust error handling and logging mechanisms should be used.

### Example of `db.properties` File

The `db.properties` file should contain the database connection details in key-value pairs. Here's an example:

```properties
url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
username=myuser
password=mypassword
```

### Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how you can use the `ConnectionFactory` class in your application:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConnectionFactory factory = ConnectionFactory.getConnectionFactory();
        Connection connection = factory.getConnection();
        
        if (connection != null) {
            System.out.println("Database connected!");
            // Perform database operations
            
            try {
                connection.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to connect to database.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we get the `ConnectionFactory` instance, obtain a `Connection`, and check if the connection is successful. If successful, we can perform database operations and then close the connection.

### Summary

- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a single instance of `ConnectionFactory`.
- **Properties Management:** Externalizes database configuration.
- **Connection Handling:** Provides a method to obtain database connections.
- **Exception Handling:** Catches and prints exceptions, but could be enhanced for production use.

This design promotes clean code practices, configuration management, and efficient resource handling in database operations.
