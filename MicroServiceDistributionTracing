### Simple Explanation of Distributed Tracing

Think of distributed tracing like following a trail of breadcrumbs to understand how a package (or in this case, a request) travels through a series of checkpoints (or services) to reach its destination. 

#### Real-Time Scenario: Ordering a Pizza

Imagine you order a pizza online from a restaurant that uses multiple systems to handle your order:

1. **You Place an Order**: You go to the pizza restaurant’s website and place an order. This triggers the process.

2. **Order Confirmation**: The website's ordering system sends your order details to the kitchen.

3. **Payment Processing**: The kitchen system sends the order to a payment system to process your payment.

4. **Notification**: Once the payment is approved, the system sends you a confirmation email about your order.

Here’s how distributed tracing helps in this scenario:

1. **Start of the Trace**: When you place the order, a trace is started. This trace records the journey of your order from start to finish.

2. **Service Checks**: Each system involved in your order (ordering system, payment system, notification system) creates its own "span," which is like a note that records how long each system takes to handle your part of the order.

3. **Combine the Spans**: All these notes (spans) are put together to form a complete picture of your order’s journey. This helps in understanding how long each part of the process took and where any delays happened.

#### Example in Practice

Let’s say there’s a delay in your order confirmation. With distributed tracing, the restaurant’s tech team can:

1. **Follow the Trail**: Check the trace to see each system's handling time (e.g., the payment system took too long).

2. **Identify Problems**: Quickly pinpoint that the issue was with the payment processing system and fix it.

3. **Improve Performance**: Understand where improvements can be made, like speeding up payment processing.

Distributed tracing makes it easier to track and solve problems by showing the complete path of your order through all systems involved.
