### Introduction

**Java EE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition):**
Java EE is a platform that provides tools and libraries for building large-scale applications, especially those used in businesses. Think of it as a toolbox full of ready-made parts you can use to create complex web applications, handle large amounts of data, or build systems that work across different computers and networks. It includes everything from basic web pages to complex services that can communicate with other systems or applications.

**Apache Tomcat:**
Apache Tomcat is a software that acts like a server for your web applications. When you create a web application using Java, you need a place to run it, and that's where Tomcat comes in. It’s like a middleman that understands how to take the code you write and serve it to people who want to use your application over the internet.

Tomcat specifically handles things built with Java technologies like Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and EL (Expression Language). These are just different ways to create dynamic content on the web, like generating a webpage on the fly based on user input or interacting with a database. Tomcat ensures that all these processes run smoothly so users can interact with your web application seamlessly.

### Servlet Container

**Servlet Container:**
A Servlet Container, sometimes called a servlet engine, is a key part of a web server that manages Java servlets. Servlets are small Java programs that run on the server and respond to requests from web browsers. The Servlet Container controls the lifecycle of these servlets, meaning it takes care of creating, running, and destroying them as needed. It also handles communication between the server and the client, making sure that the requests (like a user trying to load a webpage) are processed and the correct responses (like sending back the requested webpage) are returned. Additionally, it provides important services to servlets, such as managing user sessions and accessing resources like files or databases.

**Web.xml:**
The `web.xml` file is a configuration file for your web application. It lives in the `WEB-INF` directory of your project and tells the web server how to handle incoming requests. For example, it maps specific URL patterns to certain servlets, so when a user tries to access a specific part of your website, the server knows which servlet to use to process that request. It can also contain other important settings, such as security configurations or initialization parameters.

**Dispatcher Servlet:**
The Dispatcher Servlet is a special type of servlet that plays a central role in applications that follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. In simple terms, the Dispatcher Servlet acts as a traffic controller. When a request comes in, it decides which part of the application should handle it—whether it's a JSP page (which handles the view part), another servlet, or some other resource. By routing requests to the right place, the Dispatcher Servlet helps organize and manage the flow of data and actions within the application, making it easier to maintain and expand.

### Servlets Explained Simply

Imagine you're at a restaurant. When you place an order, a waiter takes your request, goes to the kitchen, and then brings back your food. In this scenario:

- **You** are like a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- **The waiter** is like a servlet.
- **The kitchen** is like the server where the website is hosted.

A **servlet** is a small program that runs on a server. Its job is to take requests from users (like you asking for a webpage) and then return the appropriate response (like showing you the webpage). Here’s how it works in simple steps:

1. **Receiving a Request:** When you type a URL or click a link, your browser sends a request to a server. The server has a servlet waiting to handle that request.

2. **Processing the Request:** The servlet receives this request and figures out what you need. For example, if you’re asking to log in, the servlet might check your username and password.

3. **Generating a Response:** After processing your request, the servlet sends back a response. This might be a webpage, a piece of data, or even an error message if something went wrong.

4. **Sending the Response:** The server sends this response back to your browser, which then displays it to you.

In summary, a servlet is like a middleman on a web server that processes user requests and sends back the right information. It helps web applications run smoothly by managing these interactions behind the scenes.

==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


Sure! Let's break this down with a real-time example of an e-commerce web application to explain each component in detail:

### 1. **Servlet Container**

**Definition:** A servlet container (or servlet engine) is a part of a web server or application server that manages the lifecycle of servlets, handles incoming requests, and sends responses. It also provides additional services such as session management and resource handling.

**Example:**
Imagine you're running an online store. When a user visits your site, they might request to view a product page. The servlet container processes this request, manages the servlet that handles this request, and then sends the response (e.g., the product page) back to the user.

**How it Works:**
- **Lifecycle Management:** The container initializes servlets when the application starts and destroys them when the application is stopped.
- **Request Handling:** It processes HTTP requests, invokes the appropriate servlet, and manages the response.

### 2. **web.xml**

**Definition:** The `web.xml` file is an XML configuration file located in the `WEB-INF` directory of a web application. It configures servlets, servlet mappings, and other settings like context parameters.

**Example:**
In our online store, you might have different servlets to handle various aspects of the site, such as product listing, user login, and shopping cart management. You use `web.xml` to map URL patterns to these servlets.

**Example Configuration in web.xml:**
```xml
<web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_1.xsd"
         version="3.1">

    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>ProductServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.example.ProductServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>ProductServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/product</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>LoginServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.example.LoginServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>LoginServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/login</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
    
</web-app>
```
In this example:
- `ProductServlet` handles requests to `/product`.
- `LoginServlet` handles requests to `/login`.

Certainly! Let’s simplify the `web.xml` configuration using a straightforward example:

### What is `web.xml`?

The `web.xml` file is like a map for your web application. It tells the web server how to handle different types of requests from users. Specifically, it maps URLs (web addresses) to different pieces of code (servlets) that handle those requests.

### How Does `web.xml` Work?

Imagine you have a website for an online store with three main pages:
1. **Product Page**
2. **Login Page**
3. **Shopping Cart**

Each page needs a specific piece of code (servlet) to handle user interactions. `web.xml` helps the web server know which code to use for each page.

### Simple Example

Let's break down a basic `web.xml` configuration for our online store:

```xml
<web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
         version="3.1">
    
    <!-- Configuration for ProductServlet -->
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>ProductServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.example.ProductServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>ProductServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/product</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
    
    <!-- Configuration for LoginServlet -->
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>LoginServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.example.LoginServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>LoginServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/login</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
    
    <!-- Configuration for CartServlet -->
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>CartServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.example.CartServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>CartServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/cart</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
    
</web-app>
```

### How to Read This:

1. **Define the Servlets:**
   - Each `<servlet>` block defines a piece of code (servlet) that will handle certain types of requests.
   - `<servlet-name>` gives a name to the servlet (e.g., `ProductServlet`).
   - `<servlet-class>` specifies the Java class that contains the code for this servlet (e.g., `com.example.ProductServlet`).

2. **Map URLs to Servlets:**
   - Each `<servlet-mapping>` block maps a URL pattern to a specific servlet.
   - `<url-pattern>` specifies the URL path that will trigger this servlet (e.g., `/product`).

### What Happens in Practice:

- **User visits `/product`:** The web server looks at `web.xml`, sees that `/product` maps to `ProductServlet`, and runs the code in `ProductServlet` to handle the request.
- **User visits `/login`:** The server uses `LoginServlet` for this request.
- **User visits `/cart`:** The server uses `CartServlet` for this request.

This setup ensures that when a user requests a specific page on your site, the web server knows exactly which piece of code to use to handle that request and generate the appropriate response.

### 3. **Dispatcher Servlet**

**Definition:** A dispatcher servlet is a special type of servlet that acts as a central controller in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. It processes incoming requests, delegates them to the appropriate handlers (like other servlets or controllers), and forwards the response to the client.

**Example:**
In our online store, you might have a dispatcher servlet that handles all incoming requests and decides which specific servlet or resource (like a JSP page) should handle the request.

**How it Works:**
1. **Request Handling:** The dispatcher servlet receives a request from the user.
2. **Delegation:** It delegates the request to the appropriate controller or servlet based on the request URL.
3. **Forwarding:** After processing, it forwards the response to a JSP page or another servlet for rendering.

**Example:**
If a user requests the URL `/viewProduct?id=123`, the dispatcher servlet might forward this request to `ProductServlet` to handle the product display logic and then forward the result to a JSP page for presentation.

### Putting It All Together

In the context of our e-commerce web application:
- The **Servlet Container** manages the servlets' lifecycle, handles requests, and sends responses.
- The **web.xml** file maps URLs to servlets and provides configuration details.
- The **Dispatcher Servlet** handles the routing of requests, delegates them to the appropriate servlets or controllers, and forwards the response to the user.

This setup ensures that your application can handle various user interactions efficiently, from displaying products to managing user sessions and handling shopping cart operations.

===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Let's break down the servlet lifecycle with a simple real-time example of an online store:

### Example Scenario

Imagine you have a servlet named `ProductServlet` that handles requests related to product information in your online store. Here's how the servlet lifecycle phases would work for this servlet:

### 1. **init Phase**

**Definition:** The `init` method is called once when the servlet is first loaded into memory. It initializes the servlet and prepares it for handling requests.

**Example:**
When the server starts up or when the servlet is first accessed, the `ProductServlet` is initialized. In this phase, it might connect to a database or set up necessary resources.

**Code Example:**
```java
public class ProductServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    public void init() throws ServletException {
        // Initialization code here, e.g., connect to a database
        System.out.println("ProductServlet initialized.");
    }
}
```

### 2. **service Phase**

**Definition:** The `service` method is called to handle each request to the servlet. This is where the main request processing happens.

**Example:**
When a user requests information about a product by visiting `/product?id=123`, the `service` method is called. This method determines whether the request is a GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE request and delegates the request to the appropriate method (e.g., `doGet`, `doPost`).

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override
protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    // Delegate request based on HTTP method
    String method = request.getMethod();
    if (method.equalsIgnoreCase("GET")) {
        doGet(request, response);
    } else if (method.equalsIgnoreCase("POST")) {
        doPost(request, response);
    }
    // Handle PUT, DELETE if necessary
}
```

### 3. **doGet Method**

**Definition:** The `doGet` method handles HTTP GET requests, which are typically used to retrieve data from the server.

**Example:**
When a user wants to view the details of a product, they might request `/product?id=123`. The `doGet` method processes this request, retrieves the product information from the database, and sends it back to the user.

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    String productId = request.getParameter("id");
    // Fetch product details from the database using productId
    // Send product details in the response
    response.getWriter().write("Product details for ID: " + productId);
}
```

### 4. **doPost Method**

**Definition:** The `doPost` method handles HTTP POST requests, which are typically used to submit data to the server.

**Example:**
When a user submits a form to add a new product, they might send a POST request to `/addProduct`. The `doPost` method processes this request and updates the database with the new product information.

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    String productName = request.getParameter("name");
    String productPrice = request.getParameter("price");
    // Add the new product to the database
    response.getWriter().write("Product added: " + productName);
}
```

### 5. **doPut Method**

**Definition:** The `doPut` method handles HTTP PUT requests, which are typically used to update existing resources on the server.

**Example:**
If a user wants to update product information, they might send a PUT request to `/updateProduct`. The `doPut` method updates the existing product details in the database.

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override
protected void doPut(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    String productId = request.getParameter("id");
    String newProductName = request.getParameter("name");
    // Update the product information in the database
    response.getWriter().write("Product updated: " + newProductName);
}
```

### 6. **doDelete Method**

**Definition:** The `doDelete` method handles HTTP DELETE requests, which are used to delete resources on the server.

**Example:**
If a user wants to delete a product, they might send a DELETE request to `/deleteProduct?id=123`. The `doDelete` method deletes the product from the database.

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override
protected void doDelete(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    String productId = request.getParameter("id");
    // Delete the product from the database
    response.getWriter().write("Product deleted: " + productId);
}
```

### 7. **destroy Phase**

**Definition:** The `destroy` method is called once when the servlet is being unloaded or the server is shutting down. It allows the servlet to clean up resources and perform final tasks.

**Example:**
Before the server shuts down or the servlet is unloaded, the `destroy` method might close database connections or release other resources.

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override
public void destroy() {
    // Cleanup code here, e.g., close database connections
    System.out.println("ProductServlet destroyed.");
}
```

### Summary

1. **init:** Set up resources when the servlet is first loaded.
2. **service:** Handle each request and delegate to `doGet`, `doPost`, etc.
3. **doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete:** Handle specific types of requests (retrieve, submit, update, delete).
4. **destroy:** Clean up resources when the servlet is unloaded.

This lifecycle ensures that your servlet is properly initialized, can handle various types of requests, and can clean up resources when it's no longer needed.

================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Certainly! Let’s break down each concept with a real-time example for better understanding:

### 4. Servlet Mapping

**Servlet Mapping** is about defining which servlet handles which URL patterns in your web application. This is done in the `web.xml` file.

#### Example Scenario

In your online store, you have the following servlets:
- `ProductServlet` for handling product-related requests.
- `UserServlet` for handling user-related requests.

You want `ProductServlet` to handle requests to `/product` and `UserServlet` to handle requests to `/user`.

**web.xml Configuration:**
```xml
<web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
                             http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_1.xsd"
         version="3.1">

    <!-- Servlet Declaration -->
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>ProductServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.example.ProductServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>UserServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>com.example.UserServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

    <!-- Servlet Mapping -->
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>ProductServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/product</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
    
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>UserServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/user</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
```

**Explanation:**
- Requests to `/product` are handled by `ProductServlet`.
- Requests to `/user` are handled by `UserServlet`.

### 5. Request & Response

**HttpServletRequest** and **HttpServletResponse** are fundamental for interacting with clients.

#### HttpServletRequest

- **Represents**: The data sent by the client to the server.
- **Contains**: Request parameters, HTTP headers, and session data.

**Example:**
When a user submits a login form, the form data is sent to the server. The `HttpServletRequest` object allows you to access this data.

**Code Example:**
```java
String username = request.getParameter("username");
String password = request.getParameter("password");
```

Here, `request.getParameter("username")` retrieves the username submitted by the user in the form.

#### HttpServletResponse

- **Represents**: The data the server sends back to the client.
- **Allows**: Sending content, setting response headers, and controlling status codes.

**Example:**
After processing a login request, you want to send a response indicating whether the login was successful.

**Code Example:**
```java
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
out.println("<html><body>");
out.println("<h1>Login Successful</h1>");
out.println("</body></html>");
```

Here, `response.setContentType("text/html")` sets the content type, and `response.getWriter().println(...)` sends HTML content back to the client.

### Request Dispatcher & Redirect

**Request Dispatcher** and **Redirect** are ways to forward or redirect requests.

#### Request Dispatcher

- **Purpose**: Forward a request to another resource within the same web application (e.g., from a servlet to a JSP).
- **Usage**: You use it when you want to forward the request and response objects to another resource for further processing.

**Example:**
Forwarding to a JSP page to display product details.

**Code Example:**
```java
RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("productDetails.jsp");
dispatcher.forward(request, response);
```

Here, `request.getRequestDispatcher("productDetails.jsp")` creates a `RequestDispatcher` for the JSP page, and `dispatcher.forward(request, response)` forwards the request and response to the JSP page.

#### Redirect

- **Purpose**: Redirect the client to a different URL, causing a new request from the client.
- **Usage**: Use it when you need to send the client to a different page or URL.

**Example:**
After a successful login, redirecting the user to their profile page.

**Code Example:**
```java
response.sendRedirect("profile.jsp");
```

Here, `response.sendRedirect("profile.jsp")` sends a redirect response to the client, causing the browser to navigate to `profile.jsp`.

### Summary

1. **Servlet Mapping**: Defines which servlet handles which URL patterns in `web.xml`.
2. **HttpServletRequest**: Represents the client's request, including parameters and headers.
3. **HttpServletResponse**: Represents the server's response, allowing you to send data and set headers.
4. **Request Dispatcher**: Forwards a request to another resource within the same application.
5. **Redirect**: Sends the client to a different URL, causing a new request from the client.

These concepts help you manage how your web application processes and responds to requests, and they provide flexibility in handling and routing user interactions.

======================================================================================================================================================================================================

Sure! Let’s dive into session management with a real-time example to make it clear.

### What is a Session?

A **session** in a web application is a way to maintain state and track user interactions over multiple HTTP requests. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent and doesn’t retain information from previous requests. Sessions solve this problem by keeping track of the user’s state across different requests.

### How Sessions Work

1. **Session Creation**:
   - When a user first interacts with a web application, the server creates a new session and assigns a unique session ID to it.
   - This session ID is usually sent to the client as a cookie or as part of the URL.

2. **Session Tracking**:
   - For each subsequent request, the client sends the session ID back to the server.
   - The server uses this ID to retrieve the session data and continue managing the user’s state.

3. **Session Termination**:
   - Sessions can end in various ways: the user logs out, the session expires after a period of inactivity, or the server is restarted.

### Real-Time Example: Online Shopping Cart

Let’s consider an example of an online shopping website where a user adds items to their shopping cart.

#### 1. **Session Creation**

When the user visits the site and starts browsing:

- **Session Initialization**: The server creates a new session for this user. For example, when they access the shopping page for the first time, a new session is created with a unique ID (e.g., `JSESSIONID=12345`).

#### 2. **Session Tracking**

As the user continues to interact with the website:

- **Adding Items**: The user adds items to their shopping cart. Each time they do this, the information about the items (e.g., product ID, quantity) is stored in the session.
- **Session Data**: The `HttpSession` object manages this data. For instance, if the user adds a "Laptop" and a "Smartphone" to their cart, this information is stored in the session.

**Code Example**:
```java
// Get the session object
HttpSession session = request.getSession();

// Add items to the session
List<String> cart = (List<String>) session.getAttribute("cart");
if (cart == null) {
    cart = new ArrayList<>();
    session.setAttribute("cart", cart);
}
cart.add("Laptop");
```

Here:
- `request.getSession()` retrieves the session object.
- `session.getAttribute("cart")` fetches the current cart, or initializes it if it doesn’t exist.
- Items are added to the cart and stored in the session.

#### 3. **Session Usage**

During the same browsing session, the user might:

- **View Cart**: The user can view their shopping cart, and the server retrieves the cart data from the session.

**Code Example**:
```java
// Retrieve the cart from the session
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
List<String> cart = (List<String>) session.getAttribute("cart");

// Display the cart items
response.getWriter().println("Items in your cart: " + cart);
```

#### 4. **Session Termination**

When the user logs out or after a period of inactivity:

- **Session Expiry**: The session can expire, or it can be invalidated when the user logs out. The server will no longer have access to the session data.

**Code Example**:
```java
// Invalidate the session when the user logs out
HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);
if (session != null) {
    session.invalidate();
}
```

Here, `session.invalidate()` removes the session and all associated data.

### Summary

1. **Session Creation**: Occurs when the user first interacts with the web application. The server assigns a unique session ID.
2. **Session Tracking**: The server uses the session ID to maintain state and track user interactions across multiple requests.
3. **Session Data Management**: Data related to the user’s interactions (e.g., items in the shopping cart) is stored in the session.
4. **Session Termination**: Sessions can be invalidated or expire based on user actions or time.

Sessions are essential for web applications that need to maintain user state and data across multiple interactions, providing a seamless and personalized experience.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Let's break down path variables and query parameters with a real-time example to help you understand how they work.

### Path Variables

**Path Variables** are used in RESTful web services and URLs to represent dynamic segments of the URL path. They allow you to pass information directly in the URL, making it part of the URL structure.

#### Real-Time Example: Online Store Product Details

Imagine you have a web application for an online store. You want to view details for a specific product. Instead of using query parameters, you use path variables to make the URL cleaner and more intuitive.

#### URL with Path Variables

**URL Format:**
```
/products/{productId}
```

Here, `{productId}` is a path variable that represents the ID of the product you want to view. For example:
```
/products/123
```

**Servlet Handling Path Variables:**

In a servlet, you would extract the path variable from the URL to get the product ID.

**Code Example:**
```java
@WebServlet("/products/*")
public class ProductServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Extract the path info from the URL
        String pathInfo = request.getPathInfo();
        if (pathInfo != null && pathInfo.startsWith("/")) {
            pathInfo = pathInfo.substring(1); // Remove leading slash
        }
        
        // Extract productId from path info
        String productId = pathInfo;
        
        // Retrieve product details using the productId
        // (e.g., fetch from a database)
        
        response.getWriter().write("Product details for ID: " + productId);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The servlet is mapped to handle URLs like `/products/*`.
- The `request.getPathInfo()` method retrieves the path part after `/products/`, which is the product ID.
- The `productId` is then used to fetch and display product details.

### Query Parameters

**Query Parameters** are used in URLs to pass additional data to the server. They are included in the query string of the URL, which starts after the `?` character and consists of key-value pairs separated by `&`.

#### Real-Time Example: Product Search

Suppose you want to search for products based on criteria like category or price range. You use query parameters to pass these search criteria in the URL.

#### URL with Query Parameters

**URL Format:**
```
/search?category=electronics&price=100-500
```

Here, `category` and `price` are query parameters with values `electronics` and `100-500`, respectively.

**Servlet Handling Query Parameters:**

In a servlet, you can access query parameters using `request.getParameter()`.

**Code Example:**
```java
@WebServlet("/search")
public class SearchServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Get query parameters
        String category = request.getParameter("category");
        String priceRange = request.getParameter("price");
        
        // Perform search based on the category and price range
        // (e.g., query the database and retrieve matching products)
        
        response.getWriter().write("Search results for category: " + category + " and price range: " + priceRange);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The servlet is mapped to handle URLs like `/search`.
- `request.getParameter("category")` retrieves the value of the `category` query parameter.
- `request.getParameter("price")` retrieves the value of the `price` query parameter.
- The parameters are used to perform a search and generate search results.

### Summary

1. **Path Variables**:
   - **Purpose**: Represent dynamic segments of the URL path.
   - **Example**: `/products/123` where `123` is a path variable representing a product ID.
   - **Usage**: Extracted using `request.getPathInfo()` in servlets.

2. **Query Parameters**:
   - **Purpose**: Pass additional data in the URL query string.
   - **Example**: `/search?category=electronics&price=100-500` where `category` and `price` are query parameters.
   - **Usage**: Accessed using `request.getParameter("name")` in servlets.

Both path variables and query parameters are used to pass information to the server, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts to structure and retrieve data.
